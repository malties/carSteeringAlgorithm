## How to plan to collaborate

We plan on using a  Waterfall style of of development for this project, as opposed to an agile method, so following this we will create 
an initial plan that we intend to use for the duration of this project, which will not change significantly with the exception of if our decided method 
will not work, not a good implementation, etc.
During development, we plan on using pair programming as a way of collaboration. Both pairs would communicate with each other 
to keep track of the progress of the project. A meeting is held per each assignment or problem, where we would 
break down the assignment into subproblems or tasks, and each pair assigns themselves to tasks and responsibilities. 

## How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?

We will create a Gitlab board where tasks and responsibilities are documented. 
On the board, each task has a start period and a deadline.Tasks with highest priority have a buffer period, to ensure that a task is done well and to avoid delays.  
Each person would move their assigned task along the different stages (such as in progress, testing, completed) to indicate their progress. 
In case a team member realises that a task won’t be completed by its scheduled deadline, then he/she must inform the whole team. The same rule applies if a member is unable to perform the task. It is also important that commit messages are clear and detailed enough to describe what the code in the commit does. Major code changes should be announced on Messenger.


## How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?

Whenever we solve a task we will discuss how we solved the task with our members, 
as well as uploading a document to our shared Google Drive outlining how tasks were solved so everyone has a shared understanding.

## What is our usual communication plan?

We plan to hold digital meetings two to three times a week, where we update each other about our progress and the difficulties we may be experiencing. We will follow a general agenda: 
1. Cover what we have done so far regarding tasks
2. Share any concerns or difficulties 
3. Reflect on the process, and suggest improvements 
4. Prepare for the next sprint by doing sprint planning (break down large tasks into smaller tasks, assign tasks to member, create start time and deadline for each task)

We also plan on staying in touch through Facebook Messenger. Meetings will be held via Discord.


## How will we solve conflicts?

Depending on the type of conflict, whether it’s a personal issue or a disagreement over how a problem or task should be solved, we will start with a discussion between the people involved. 
If it cannot be resolved in this way, we will discuss the problem as a group, and if it is something pertaining to implementation, we will vote as a group on what we believe the best decision will be.
In case of a tie in voting, we will present our options to the TAs/ teacher, and we would base our decision based on their opinions. 

If there is a serious issue (e.g. bullying, racism, sexual harassment, discrimination of any kind, etc) with a team member, the issue will be brought to the course responsible where it can be handled in accordance with the school’s policies.
