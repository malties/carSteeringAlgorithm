## How to plan to collaborate

We plan on using pair programming as a way of collaboration. 
Both pairs would communicate with each other to keep track of the progress of the project. 
A meeting is held per each assignment or problem, where we would break down the assignment into subproblems or tasks, and each pair assigns themselves to tasks and responsibilities.

## How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?

Commit messages should be clear and detailed enough to describe what the code in the commit does. 
Major code changes should be announced on Messenger.  We will als create a Trello board where tasks and responsibilities are documented. 
Each person would move the task along the different stages (such as in progress, testing, completed) to indicate their progress.

## How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?

Whenever we solve a task we will discuss how we solved the task with our members, 
as well as uploading a document to our shared Google Drive outlining how tasks were solved so everyone has a shared understanding.

## What is our usual communication plan?

We plan to hold digital meetings two to three times a week, where we update each other about our progress and the difficulties we may be experiencing. 
We also plan on staying in touch through Facebook Messenger.  Meetings will be held via Discord.

## How will we solve conflicts?

Depending on the type of conflict, whether itâ€™s a personal issue or a disagreement over how a problem or task should be solved, 
we will start with a discussion between the people involved. If it cannot be resolved in this way, we will discuss the problem as a group,
and if it is something pertaining to implementation, we will vote as a group on what we believe the best decision will be.
